            <p>
              Hello! I am Lareb Noor, a passionate web developer with a deep
              love for building functional and beautiful digital experiences. My
              journey into the world of coding began 1 year ago when I
              realized how technology could turn creative ideas into reality.
              Since then, I&apos;ve been honing my skills in web development,
              specializing in both front-end and back-end technologies such as
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Figma, GitHub, React,
              Node.js, and Next.js. My goal is to always build websites that are not
              only visually appealing but also user-friendly and accessible to
              everyone. I love solving problems and embracing challenges, which
              is why I am constantly learning and experimenting with new
              technologies and tools. I am always looking for
              exciting projects to work on, so feel free to reach out if you
              think we would be a great fit!
