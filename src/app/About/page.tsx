                Hello! Iam Lareb Noor, a passionate web developer with a deep
                love for building functional and beautiful digital experiences. My
                journey into the world of coding began 1 years ago when I
                realized how technology could turn creative ideas into reality.
                Since then, Ive been honing my skills in web development,
                specializing in both front-end and back-end technologies such as
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript figma github React,
                Node.js, Next.js. My goal is to always build websites that are not
                only visually appealing but also user-friendly and accessible to
                everyone. I love solving problems and embracing challenges, which
                is why Iam constantly learning and experimenting with new
                technologies and tools.
                Iam always looking for
                exciting projects to work on, so feel free to reach out if you
                think we would be a great fit!
